        <p>Hi, My name is Ean and some things I like to do is screenshoting every homework and putting it in my reminders so I dont forget about it cause I am very forgetful. 
            I take pictures of everything that i need to know then i turn them into mini note sections so i can study them. 
            I set many different alarms because i'm a heavy sleeper and i like to wake up on time.
             I like to play many different sports some that i like to play are basketball, volleyball, and football. 
             One sport that i was on a team for was volleyball where me and my team made it to championships.</p>
